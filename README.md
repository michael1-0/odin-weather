# Weather App Using Visual Crossing Weather API
This is a project from The Odin Project, the goal of this project is to practice Javascript Asynchronous Javscript and fetching of Visual Crossing Weather API.

I used Webpack for bundling, ESLint for linting, and Prettier for formatting.

ES6 Classes, modules are used to organize code; I put DOM logic classes inside the folder `src/js/dom` and the weather data processing inside `src/js/weather-data`.
